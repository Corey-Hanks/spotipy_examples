# spotipy_examples
example uses of the spotipy library to utilize the Spotify API

There are two examples:
- Playlist Track Data (playlist_tracks.py) - given a specific playlist, the script generates a .csv of every track with extended track metadata
- Text Search Results to Track Data (text_to_uri_search.py) - given an input list of text (typically an artist-track pairing), the script identifies the track based on top search result, and packages all results into an output .csv
